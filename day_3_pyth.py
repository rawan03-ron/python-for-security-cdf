#the first command :

import requests  # third-party HTTP library

# Technique 1: make a request, inspect status_code / headers / text
demo_url = "https://httpbin.org/json"  # a public test endpoint returning JSON
response = requests.get(demo_url)  # issue an HTTP GET request

print("status code:", response.status_code)  # the numeric HTTP status returned
print("headers (subset):", dict(list(response.headers.items())[:3]))  # first 3 response headers as a dict
print("body preview:", response.text[:100])  # first 100 characters of the response body


# Technique 2: loop over multiple URLs, flag anything that isn't 200
demo_urls = [
    "https://httpbin.org/status/200",  # endpoint that always returns 200
    "https://httpbin.org/status/403",  # endpoint that always returns 403
    "https://httpbin.org/status/404",  # endpoint that always returns 404
]  # list of test endpoints to check

for u in demo_urls:  # loop over each URL
    r = requests.get(u)  # request the URL
    flag = "" if r.status_code == 200 else "  <-- FLAGGED"  # mark anything that isn't a 200 OK
    print(f"{u} -> {r.status_code}{flag}")  # print the URL, its status, and any flag
